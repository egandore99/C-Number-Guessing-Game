# C#-Number-Guessing-Game
This is a simple number guessing game built using C# and .NET. The program generates a random number, and you try to guess it by receiving hints like "too high" or "too low." Includes customizable difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) to adjust the range of numbers. A great beginner project to learn the basics of C# programming, loops, and conditionals.
